We were able to talk a little with our client, but we haven't been able to meet with him yet.

We got a list of goals for what needed to be done for sprint 3, and some guidance on how we
should go about accomplishing that. After getting that basis, we all have a good idea of where
we need to go from here and how to get started. One main topic was the display of the commits
needs to be done first since that was a goal in the last sprint that was not completed.

There is a meeting planned this Saturday, 10/28, at 10:00 am to get a more in depth conversation
on this sprint. We plan to discuss any issues we have found concerning our goals so far this sprint,
and to make a plan to ensure we are on track to accomplish those goals by the end of demo day.
