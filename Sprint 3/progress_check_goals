Sprint 3 Goals:

1. Redo the the CSV data question extraction for both the client and student surveys to order them so its easier for the program to read them.
    - we spent time on creating separate ruby files outside the main project as a way to get familiar with the CSV libraries provided by ruby. 
    - we were able to produce shorter and clearer code revolving around data extraction 
    - while doing so we have found more hardcoded inconsistencies between the client and student survey-related functions:
         -the most notable one is the client and student being hardcoded into accepting the same outputs for performance when they are different in the actual data.  
2. Overhaul the current scoring for client and student surveys since it is currently hardcoded into the application.
    -    With the side programs done we are now focused on refactoring the code to break down the semester_controller.rb into into helper functions and then 
slowly replacing the hardcoded functions with more dynamic ones 
3. Expand on the Github API integration to take input from the user to specify any repo that the user wants to access, as well as incorporate
   a way to input a time range so commits for each sprint can be viewed.

4. Implement the graph and chart so the responses containing the commits can be easily read by the user.
