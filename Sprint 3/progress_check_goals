Sprint 3 Goals:

1. Redo the the CSV data question extraction for both the client and student surveys to order them so its easier for the program to read them.

2. Overhaul the current scoring for client and student surveys since it is currently hardcoded into the application.

3. Expand on the Github API integration to take input from the user to specify any repo that the user wants to access, as well as incorporate
   a way to input a time range so commits for each sprint can be viewed.

4. Implement the graph and chart so the responses containing the commits can be easily read by the user.
