Josh:
So far this sprint, I haven't run into many problems. I have a good understanding of what I need
to get done this sprint and how to go about completing it.


Denzel :
for sprint 3 i believe i have a clear understanding of whats need to be done in terms of extracting student data 
with a function, Once we meet with our client on sat i believe we would heading in the right direction to gain the relevant data needed.
